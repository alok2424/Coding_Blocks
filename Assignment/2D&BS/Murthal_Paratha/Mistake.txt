🔑 Hint:

For each cook, you need to calculate how many parathas that cook can make within mid minutes, then sum for all cooks.

2️⃣ Think per cook (VERY IMPORTANT)

For a cook with rank R:

Time taken for:

1st parantha → R

2nd parantha → 2R

3rd parantha → 3R

...

k-th parantha → kR

So total time for k paranthas:

R * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k)
= R * k * (k + 1) / 2

❓ Question to ask yourself:

“What is the maximum k such that
R * k * (k + 1) / 2 <= mid ?”

You do NOT need formula inversion — just keep adding until time exceeds mid.

3️⃣ Pseudothinking (not code)

For each cook:

time = 0
count = 1
while(time + count * R <= mid):
    time += count * R
    curr_paratha++
    count++


⚠️ Stop when time exceeds mid
